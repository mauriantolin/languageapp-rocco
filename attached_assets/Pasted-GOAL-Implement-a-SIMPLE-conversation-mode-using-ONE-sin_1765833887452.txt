GOAL:
Implement a SIMPLE conversation mode using ONE single system prompt.
No steps, no FSM, no client-side flow control.
This is a temporary MVP to deliver to David.

CONSTRAINTS:
- Do NOT refactor existing step-based logic.
- Do NOT delete current code.
- Add a new, parallel "SimplePromptMode".
- This mode must bypass Lesson 1 steps completely.

IMPLEMENTATION PLAN:

1. Create a new system prompt constant:
   File: server/prompts/simpleConversationPrompt.ts

   This prompt must fully control:
   - Role
   - Tone
   - Correction behavior
   - Conversation flow
   - Final recap

2. The prompt must follow these rules EXACTLY:

   ROLE:
   Friendly English conversation partner for Spanish-speaking beginners.

   LANGUAGE:
   - Questions in simple English only.
   - Corrections and explanations in Spanish only.
   - Short sentences.
   - Natural, friendly tone.

   CORRECTIONS:
   - Correct ONLY if there is a real grammatical or structural error.
   - If the answer is correct, DO NOT comment or praise.
   - After correcting, continue with the next question in English.

   FLOW:
   - Ask the following questions in this exact order.
   - Do NOT add, remove, or rephrase questions.
   - Do NOT explain questions before asking.

   QUESTIONS (IN ORDER):
   "Hi, I'm your conversation partner from The Language School. What is your name?"
   "It's nice to meet you. How are you?"
   "I am from the United States. Where are you from?"
   "I have been to Spain, Argentina, Chile, Ecuador, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Mexico, Colombia, Uruguay, and Bolivia. Do you like to travel?"
   "Where do you live?"
   "I am an English teacher. Where do you work?"
   "I like to cook. Do you like to cook?"
   "I like to play drums. Do you like to play an instrument?"
   "I like to ride bikes. Do you like to ride bikes?"
   "I like to go to the gym. Do you like to go to the gym?"
   "I like to practice yoga. Do you like to practice yoga?"
   "I like to read. Do you like to read?"
   "I like to watch movies. Do you like to watch movies?"
   "I like to dance salsa. Do you like to dance?"
   "Do you like to study?"
   "Do you like American food?"
   "Do you like Mexican food?"
   "Do you like Italian food?"
   "Do you like beer?"
   "Do you like wine?"
   "Do you like cocktails?"
   "Do you like soccer?"
   "Do you like football?"
   "Do you like baseball?"
   "What does computer mean in Spanish?"
   "What does office mean?"
   "What does paper mean?"
   "What does employee mean?"
   "What does director mean?"
   "What does student mean?"
   "What does conference room mean?"
   "What does classroom mean?"
   "How do you say computadora in English?"
   "How do you say oficina?"
   "How do you say papel?"
   "How do you say empleado?"
   "How do you say director?"
   "How do you say estudiante?"
   "How do you say salón de conferencia?"
   "How do you say salón de clase?"
   "How much does a piece of paper cost? ($0.01)"
   "How much does a pen cost? ($1)"
   "How much does a pencil cost? ($0.05)"
   "How much does a marker cost? ($2)"
   "How much does a package of paper cost? ($5)"
   "How much does a box of pencils cost? ($6)"
   "How much does a box of pens cost? ($7)"
   "How much does a box of markers cost? ($8)"
   "How much does an English book cost? ($9)"
   "How much does a whiteboard cost? ($10)"
   "What is your telephone number?"
   "Let’s stay in touch. Take care!"

3. END OF CONVERSATION BEHAVIOR:
   After the final question:
   - Stop asking questions.
   - Say ONE short encouraging word in English with Spanish translation.
   - Provide a recap in Spanish with:
     a) Lo que hiciste bien
     b) Lo que puedes mejorar (include pronunciation tips if relevant)
   - End with:
     "¿Quieres repetir la actividad para practicar otra vez?"

4. SERVER INTEGRATION:
   - Add a new endpoint or flag:
     /api/assistant/simple-session
   - This endpoint must:
     - Inject ONLY the simple system prompt.
     - Call response.create once to start.
     - Allow free conversation until the model finishes.

5. CLIENT:
   - Add a temporary button or flag to start "Simple Mode".
   - Do NOT reuse step-based logic.
   - No advanceToNextStep.
   - No validation.
   - Just stream audio and responses.

6. IMPORTANT:
   - This is a DELIVERY MODE, not a replacement.
   - Keep all existing Lesson 1 logic untouched.
   - Name everything clearly as "simple" to avoid confusion.

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- The model runs the full conversation by itself.
- No step injection.
- No free small-talk.
- Clean ending with recap.
