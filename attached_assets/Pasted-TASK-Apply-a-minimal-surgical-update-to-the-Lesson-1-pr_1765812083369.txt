TASK: Apply a minimal, surgical update to the Lesson 1 prompt.

CONTEXT:
We have a production-ready Lesson 1 prompt with strict pedagogical and control rules.
The lesson logic, flow, vocabulary limits, and correction rules are FINAL and MUST NOT be changed.

PROBLEM:
The voice experience breaks due to:
1) ASR producing single-word answers (e.g. names, places)
2) The system auto-generating a session recap outside lesson control

GOAL:
Fix VOICE usability and allow FINAL FEEDBACK ONLY at system session end,
WITHOUT altering lesson behavior during the conversation.

STRICT RULES (DO NOT VIOLATE):
- Do NOT change lesson flow
- Do NOT change allowed questions
- Do NOT add new content
- Do NOT loosen topic restrictions
- Do NOT modify correction logic
- Do NOT add new pedagogical features
- Do NOT refactor structure or formatting
- Do NOT add greetings or social language

REQUIRED CHANGES (ONLY THESE):

1) VOICE INPUT EXCEPTION
Add a new section titled:
"===== VOICE INPUT EXCEPTIONS (MANDATORY) ====="

Rules:
- Single-word answers are VALID (not INVALID) ONLY when answering:
  - "What is your name?"
  - "Where are you from?"
  - "Where do you live?"
  - "Where do you work?"
- These single-word answers must be treated as INCORRECT:
  - Model the correct full sentence
  - Ask the student to repeat ONCE
- Single-word answers are also VALID for:
  - "What do you like?" (food or simple activity only)
- All other single-word inputs remain INVALID

2) LESSON START ENFORCEMENT
Add a section:
"===== LESSON START (MANDATORY) ====="

Rule:
- The FIRST assistant message MUST be exactly:
  "What is your name?"
- No greeting
- No introduction
- No additional words

3) FINAL FEEDBACK MODE
Add a section:
"===== FINAL FEEDBACK MODE (SYSTEM-TRIGGERED ONLY) ====="

Rules:
- Applies ONLY when the SYSTEM ends the session
- Provide short feedback (2–3 sentences max)
- Mention:
  - What the student practiced
  - One thing done well
  - One simple suggestion
- Use very simple English
- Do NOT ask questions
- Do NOT restart conversation
- Do NOT introduce new content

Example:
"Today you practiced introductions and likes.
You used complete sentences.
Try to speak slowly next time."

IMPORTANT:
- During the lesson, the assistant MUST NEVER summarize or give feedback
- Final feedback is allowed ONLY at system session end

OUTPUT REQUIRED:
- Return the FULL updated Lesson 1 prompt
- Preserve all original rules and wording unless explicitly changed above
- Do NOT add commentary or explanations
- Do NOT propose alternatives
