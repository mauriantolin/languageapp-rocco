TASK: Introduce explicit question flow control in the backend with MINIMAL changes.

CONTEXT:
We have a voice-based AI conversation with a fixed list of 52 questions.
Currently, the AI model decides which question comes next based on memory of the conversation.
This causes topic jumps and makes testing impossible.

IMPORTANT:
- The pedagogical prompt (SIMPLE_CONVERSATION_PROMPT) is already correct and MUST NOT be rewritten.
- Do NOT change question wording, order, or teaching rules.
- Do NOT refactor frontend logic.
- Do NOT redesign the architecture.
- Do NOT add complex state machines.
- Make the SMALLEST POSSIBLE backend change.

GOAL:
Move control of the question order from the AI model to the backend.

REQUIRED BEHAVIOR:
1. The backend must track a single integer per session:
   - currentQuestionIndex (starting at 1 by default).
2. The backend is the ONLY source of truth for which question is currently active.
3. The AI model must no longer decide which question comes next.
4. The backend sends ONLY the current question text to the model.
5. The backend advances currentQuestionIndex ONLY when the student's answer is accepted as correct and complete.
6. If the answer is incorrect or incomplete:
   - the backend keeps the same question index
   - the SAME question is asked again
7. The question index MUST advance at most once per student turn.

TESTING REQUIREMENT:
- Allow manually setting currentQuestionIndex at session start (for development/testing only).
- This must not affect production behavior for students.

STRICT CONSTRAINTS:
- Do NOT rewrite the 52 questions.
- Do NOT move questions into the prompt.
- Do NOT introduce new prompts or modes.
- Do NOT change voice, STT, or realtime handling.
- Do NOT touch UI or routing.
- Do NOT auto-skip questions.

DELIVERABLE:
- Minimal backend changes implementing the above.
- A short explanation of:
  a) where currentQuestionIndex is stored
  b) when it increments
  c) why this fixes topic jumping without changing pedagogy
