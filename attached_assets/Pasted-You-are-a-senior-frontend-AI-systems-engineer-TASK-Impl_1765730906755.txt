You are a senior frontend + AI systems engineer.

TASK
Implement an optional UI change to reduce user-facing issues caused by real-time voice transcription, while keeping the underlying AI behavior unchanged.

IMPORTANT
This change must be:
- Reversible
- Non-destructive
- Isolated to the UI layer
- Easy to disable or revert if needed

CONTEXT
This app is a voice-based English tutor.
The primary learning interaction is speaking and listening.

Current issue:
- Real-time speech-to-text transcription is shown in the chat UI.
- Transcription errors (from ASR) create confusion for users.
- These errors do not reflect actual AI understanding but degrade UX.

GOAL
Make the default user experience voice-first, without showing live transcription or chat messages.
Keep text chat available ONLY as an optional debug/testing mode.

REQUIREMENTS

1. DEFAULT MODE (Voice-only)
- When a conversation starts:
  - Do NOT display real-time transcribed user messages.
  - Do NOT display assistant text messages by default.
  - Show a simple UI indicator such as:
    “You are talking with the tutor”
- Voice interaction must continue working exactly as before.

2. OPTIONAL DEBUG / TEXT MODE
- Add a toggle or button (e.g. “Show text chat (debug)”).
- When enabled:
  - Display the existing chat UI with messages and transcriptions.
  - Allow text-based interaction for testing purposes.
- When disabled:
  - Hide all chat/transcription UI elements.

3. SCOPE LIMITS
- Do NOT change:
  - AI prompts
  - Lesson logic
  - Voice pipeline
  - Session handling
- This is a UI/UX-only change.

4. REVERSIBILITY
- Implement this as a feature flag, toggle, or clearly isolated component.
- It should be trivial to revert to “always show chat” if needed.

OUTPUT
- Updated UI with voice-only default mode.
- Optional debug/text chat toggle.
- Minimal code comments explaining intent.

DO NOT:
- Refactor unrelated code
- Optimize prompts
- Modify AI behavior
- Introduce new dependencies

Focus only on improving UX by hiding real-time transcription by default.
