Hey Rocco,
That’s awesome — I really appreciate the breakdown. The cost is incredibly reasonable and gives us lots of room to grow.


Let’s definitely stick with gpt-4o-mini for now, especially if performance looks good. I love that everything runs through our own backend and that we can control the whole experience, both from a pedagogical and brand perspective.


Yes, please go ahead and keep building out the rest of the flow. I’d also be interested in seeing how the recap logic works — how the bot identifies strengths and areas to review based on mistakes. That part is key to giving students that personalized, uplifting feedback.

Yes, you’re exactly right — I was referring to that AI chat.


Please go ahead and add Fundamentos de Inglés 1 as the first course.


We will eventually add videos and flashcards, but the AI conversation partner is what my students are most excited about and seems to be the easiest and fastest feature to build.


The goal is for the AI to behave like a friendly conversation partner who follows the flow of each lesson, as if the student were meeting a friend at a café to practice English together.


Here’s a quick breakdown of the flow I’m imagining:


1. Introduction
→ The AI should greet the student, introduce itself as The Language School’s Conversation Partner, and ask for their name.


2. Lesson Detection
→ Ask which lesson they are on from Fundamentos de Inglés 1. (e.g. “Which lesson are you working on today?”)


3. Simulated Conversation Based on the Lesson
→ Once the student answers, the AI should reference the book and create a friendly, natural conversation using only the grammar and vocabulary from that lesson. It should feel relaxed and fun, like chatting with a friend.


4. Support During Chat
→ If the student makes a mistake, the AI can gently correct them.
→ If they seem confused, it can explain simply or rephrase.
→ Throughout, it should give lots of praise and encouragement — think Dale Carnegie style.


5. End-of-Session Recap
→ At the end, the AI gives a short summary:
• What the student did well
• One or two things to review for next time


Let me know if you need help mapping out the specific flow for each lesson or how to structure the logic. I’m happy to support with that.


Thanks again! Go ahead and get started when you’re ready.
