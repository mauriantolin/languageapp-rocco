You are a senior software engineer implementing an experimental multi-agent AI architecture.

PROJECT CONTEXT
- This work is being done in a dedicated git branch.
- The production system must NOT be modified.
- All changes must be isolated and reversible.
- Do not refactor existing production code unless explicitly instructed.

ARCHITECTURE GOAL
Implement a modular multi-agent assistant architecture composed of:

1) Orchestrator Agent
- Central decision-maker
- Receives user input and conversation state
- Decides which specialized agent to invoke
- Aggregates responses into a final output

2) Specialized Agents (independent and isolated)
Each agent must:
- Have a single responsibility
- Receive structured input
- Return structured output
- Never directly respond to the user

Required agents:
- ValidationAgent: validates user input and detects errors
- ConversationAgent: generates domain-specific responses
- PedagogyAgent: explains mistakes and concepts
- ControlAgent: enforces system rules and constraints

DESIGN RULES
- Each agent must live in its own file/module
- Agents must NOT call each other directly
- All communication goes through the Orchestrator
- Use clear input/output contracts (interfaces or types)
- Keep prompts for each agent explicit and minimal
- Avoid long monolithic prompts

IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES
- Create a dedicated /agents folder
- Create an /orchestrator module
- Prompts must be externalized (not hardcoded inline)
- Architecture must be readable and easy to reason about
- Favor clarity over cleverness

NON-GOALS
- Do NOT optimize for performance
- Do NOT introduce new features to the product
- Do NOT change UI or user-facing behavior

DELIVERABLES
- Folder structure for the multi-agent system
- Initial implementation of the Orchestrator
- Stub or initial implementation for each agent
- Clear comments explaining the role of each component

If a design decision is ambiguous, stop and explain the options before coding.
Proceed incrementally and safely.
